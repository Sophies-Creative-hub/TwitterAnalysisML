## Description

1. Firstly, the necessary libraries are imported: `pandas` for data processing, `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization, and various modules from `sklearn` for machine learning.

2. The training and test data are loaded from CSV files.

3. Histograms are used to visualize the distributions of positive, negative, and neutral tweets in the training and test datasets.

4. The data is prepared for use in a machine learning model. This involves creating a bag-of-words representation of the text data using Scikit-Learn's CountVectorizer.

5. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained.

6. The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data, and the accuracy of the predictions is calculated.

7. Using some example sentences, the model is applied to predict the sentiment of the sentences, and the predictions are output.

The code thus demonstrates the entire process of conducting a simple sentiment analysis on text data. It reads in the data, prepares it, trains a model, evaluates the performance of the model, and finally makes predictions.
